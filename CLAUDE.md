## Active Handoff Protocol

If `.conductor/active-handoff.md` exists, **READ IT FIRST** before doing any work.
It contains constraints, locked files, conventions, and completed work from the
originating agent. You MUST honor all constraints listed there.

If the handoff says "CROSS-VERIFICATION REQUIRED", your self-assessment will
NOT be trusted. A different agent will verify your output against these constraints.

## Session Review Protocol

At the end of each session that produces or modifies files:
1. Run `organvm session review --latest` to get a session summary
2. Check for unimplemented plans: `organvm session plans --project .`
3. Export significant sessions: `organvm session export <id> --slug <slug>`
4. Run `organvm prompts distill --dry-run` to detect uncovered operational patterns

Transcripts are on-demand (never committed):
- `organvm session transcript <id>` — conversation summary
- `organvm session transcript <id> --unabridged` — full audit trail
- `organvm session prompts <id>` — human prompts only

## Logos Documentation Layer

**Status:** MISSING | **Symmetry:** 0.0 (VACUUM)

Nature demands a documentation counterpart. This formation maintains its narrative record in `docs/logos/`.

### The Tetradic Counterpart
- **[Telos (Idealized Form)](../docs/logos/telos.md)** — The dream and theoretical grounding.

### Alchemical I/O

## ⚡ Conductor OS Integration
This repository is a managed component of the ORGANVM meta-workspace.
- **Orchestration:** Use `conductor patch` for system status and work queue.
- **Lifecycle:** Follow the `FRAME -> SHAPE -> BUILD -> PROVE` workflow.
- **Governance:** Promotions are managed via `conductor wip promote`.
- **Intelligence:** Conductor MCP tools are available for routing and mission synthesis.
